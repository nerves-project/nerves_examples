Nerves + LiveView Example
===

This example shows a Nerves Project with a Pheonix/LiveView server embedded in the same application.  In contrast to
a [poncho project]{https://embedded-elixir.com/post/2017-05-19-poncho-projects/}, there is only one application
supervision tree containing the Phoenix Endpoint and any processes running on the device.  This example also includes 
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to give a starting point for styling and building components.

Currently the versions included are:

* `nerves`  - 1.9.1
* `phoenix`  - 1.6.15
* `phoenix_liveview` - 0.18.3
* `tailwindcss` - 0.1.9


Configuration
---

The order of configuration is loaded in a specific order:

* `config.exs`
* `host.exs` or `target.exs`  based on `MIX_TARGET`
* `prod.exs`, `dev.exs`, or `test.exs` based on `MIX_ENV`
* `runtime.exs` at runtime

To make configuration slightly more straightforward, the application is run 
with `MIX_ENV=prod` when on the device.  Therefore, the configuration for
phoenix on the target device is in the `prod.exs` config file.


Developing
---

You can start the application just like any Phoenix project:

```bash
iex -S mix phx.server
```


Flashing to a Device
---

You can burn the first image with the following commands:

```bash
# If you want to enable wifi:
# export NERVES_SSID="NetworkName" && export NERVES_PSK="password"
MIX_ENV=prod MIX_TARGET=host mix do deps.get, assets.deploy
MIX_ENV=prod MIX_TARGET=rpi3 mix do deps.get, firmware, burn
```

Once the image is running on the device, the following will build and update the firmware
over ssh.

```bash
# If you want to enable wifi:
# export NERVES_SSID="NetworkName" && export NERVES_PSK="password"
MIX_ENV=prod MIX_TARGET=host mix do deps.get, assets.deploy
MIX_ENV=prod MIX_TARGET=rpi3 mix do deps.get, firmware, upload your_app_name.local
```


Network Configuration
---

The network and WiFi configuration are specified in the `target.exs` file.  In order to
specify the network name and password, they must be set as environment variables `NERVES_SSID`
`NERVES_PSK` at runtime.

If they are not specified, a warning will be printed when building firmware, which either
gives you a chance to stop the build and add the environment variables or a clue as to 
why you are no longer able to access the device over WiFi.


Making It Your Own
---

To use this project as a start for your own Nerves/LiveView project, first replace the following strings throughout the project:

* `HelloLiveView` -> `YourAppName`
* `hello_live_view` -> `your_app_name`

```bash
# Might be necessary in MacOS to avoid a sed "illegal byte sequence" error
# export LC_CTYPE=C 
# export LANG=C

find . -type f \( -iname "*.ex*" ! -path "./deps/*" ! -path "./_build/*" \) -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' -e 's/HelloLiveView/YourAppName/g'
find . -type f \( -iname "*.ex*" ! -path "./deps/*" ! -path "./_build/*" \) -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' -e 's/hello_live_view/your_app_name/g'
sed -i '' 's/hello_live_view/your_app_name/g' ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

Then rename the files and directories in lib:

```bash
mv lib/hello_live_view lib/your_app_name
mv lib/hello_live_view_web lib/your_app_name_web
mv lib/hello_live_view.ex lib/your_app_name.ex
mv liv/hello_live_view_web.ex lib/your_app_name_web.ex
```
